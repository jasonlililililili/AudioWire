# AudioWire
Ugly but useful tool for Windows multi-speakers Output


Need to use with a virtual sound pipe device, like that created by https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/ .
The website offer its lite version free. Which suits this use case.

TO-DO:
1. Modulization
2. Function based interface rather than hardcoded implementation
3. Ultimately: build its own virtual sound pipe device
